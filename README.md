# Applied Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of hands-on machine learning and neural network experiments developed during my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering. The notebooks demonstrate the application of supervised learning algorithms, neural networks, and model evaluation techniques using standard benchmark datasets.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase foundational knowledge in machine learning, practical implementation skills, and progressive experimentation with different learning paradigms and tools.

## Contents

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks covering topics such as:

- Linear models and perceptron-based classification
- Feedforward neural networks using scikit-learn
- Neural network implementation using TensorFlow/Keras
- Dataset preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model evaluation using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices

## Algorithms & Techniques Used

- Perceptron
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Feedforward Neural Networks
- Supervised Learning
- Binary and Multiclass Classification

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Datasets

The notebooks make use of standard benchmark datasets, including:
- Iris Dataset
- Wine Dataset

These datasets are commonly used for evaluating classification models and learning algorithm behavior.

## Academic Context

These notebooks were originally developed as part of coursework in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. They have since been refactored and reorganized to reflect best practices in reproducible machine learning experimentation and professional code presentation.
